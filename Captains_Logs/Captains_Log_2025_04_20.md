# Captain's Log: Stardate 2025.04.20

Our journey with the Interactive Waveform Visualizer has been eventful. We navigated treacherous debugging sprints, wrestling with JavaScript module dependencies and taming stubborn CSS layouts, particularly the elusive spectrogram axis alignment. We refined the user interface, smoothed audio playback artifacts, implemented caching for faster loading, and battled the flickering phantom of unstyled content. The codebase was significantly refactored for modularity, paving the way for future enhancements, though not without considerable effort to resolve the resulting import/export complexities. We've emerged with a more robust and refined instrument, ready for its next phase.

## Relevant Details for Future Work

*   **Concepts Folder:** The `Concepts/` directory (sibling to this `Captains_Logs` folder) contains explorations for potential future features, including:
    *   `multi-threading.md`: Ideas for leveraging Web Workers and OffscreenCanvas to improve performance on multi-core CPUs.
    *   `audio-player.html` & `audio-player-with-button.html`: Alternative file/folder loading mechanisms (drag-and-drop, browser-specific buttons, playlists). These are currently **reference only**.
*   **Desktop App Feel:** Implemented CSS (`overflow: hidden` on `html, body`) to disable default page scrolling, aiming for a more static application feel. This sets the stage for potential future custom scroll/zoom behaviors within visualizer canvases via direct `wheel` event handling.
*   **Outstanding Bugs:**
    1.  **Layout/Sizing:** Canvas height calculations remain problematic, specifically preventing the main spectrogram from shrinking further than its current size.
    2.  **Development Caching:** Browser/Service Worker caching can interfere with development, sometimes loading outdated code. Workarounds exist (DevTools settings: Service Worker update on reload, disable network cache, clear storage), but the core behavior is inconvenient.
    3.  **Loading Progress:** The intended file loading progress bar and percentage display are not yet functional.
    4.  **Loading Overlay Color:** The loading overlay background in the Midnight Blue theme is solid black and should ideally match the theme's blue gradient. CSS overrides have been unsuccessful so far.
*   **Future Performance:** Multi-threading, as explored in `Concepts/multi-threading.md`, remains a key area for future investigation to enhance performance, particularly for CPU-intensive visualizations.

## README Update (Stardate 2025.04.20)

*   **Task:** Enhance the `README.md` file to provide a comprehensive overview of the project.
*   **Implementation:** The README was updated to include:
    *   A brief introductory description of the visualizer's purpose.
    *   A detailed breakdown of the project structure and the role of each key file/directory.
    *   A new section ("Codebase Interaction & Nuances") explaining how the JavaScript modules interact, covering initialization flow, state management, event handling, audio graph structure, visualization loops, and theme/caching logic.
    *   Updated the reference under "Current Status & Known Issues" to point to the latest Captain's Log generically, noting that new entries are appended.
*   **Goal:** Improve onboarding for collaborators (human or AI) by providing sufficient context within the README to understand the codebase without initially reading every file.
*   **Status:** Completed. The `README.md` now contains a significantly more detailed project summary. 

## Session Update (Stardate 2025.04.20)

*   **Task:** Address non-functional file loading progress display and incorrect loading overlay styling in the Midnight Blue theme.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **File Loading Progress:**
        *   Identified that progress tracking was missing for both local and preloaded files.
        *   Implemented progress tracking for preloaded file downloads (`fetch` requests) in `js/main.js` by reading the `response.body` stream and using `Content-Length`.
        *   Removed initial (unnecessary) progress logic for local file reads (`FileReader`) from `js/audio.js` as they load instantly.
        *   Added logging to the `fetch` event listener in `service-worker.js` to confirm Service Worker interception.
        *   This resolves **Outstanding Bug #3**.
    *   **Loading Overlay Styling:**
        *   Diagnosed that the Midnight Blue theme incorrectly applied the initial page load overlay's gradient style to the file loading overlay.
        *   Corrected CSS rules in `index.html` to ensure:
            *   `#initializing-overlay` uses the blue gradient in the dark theme.
            *   `#loading-overlay` uses a semi-transparent dark background (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`) in the dark theme, consistent with the light theme's behavior.
        *   Added CSS comments to clarify the distinction between the two overlays.
        *   This resolves **Outstanding Bug #4**.
    *   **Syntax Error Fix:** Resolved a minor syntax error in `js/visualizer.js` caused by leftover merge conflict markers.
    *   **Audio Playback Fix:** Addressed issue where previously playing preloaded audio files would not stop when selecting a new one. Restored the fade-out `setTimeout` in `stopAudioFile` and modified `stopAudioSource` to accept the specific `AudioBufferSourceNode` to stop, preventing race conditions where the old audio continued playing.
    *   **Loading Overlay Flash Fix:** Introduced a short delay (`setTimeout`) before showing the `#loading-overlay` in `js/main.js` to prevent a visual flash when preloaded files are served quickly from the cache.
    *   **Deployment:** Staged, committed, and pushed all related changes to the `main` branch.
*   **Status:** Completed. File loading progress is now functional, and overlay styles are corrected.
